## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: BFF routes split into infrastructure (Phase 3) + upload (Phase 4) + confirm/external (Phase 5) for focused testing
- [Roadmap]: Phases 1, 2, 3 are independent and can execute in parallel
- [Roadmap]: UI enhancements (Phase 8) depend only on Phase 1 backend fixes, not on media pipeline

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- S3 CORS configuration needed for browser direct upload to work (infrastructure, not code -- verify before Phase 7 testing)
- Railway SSE behavior may buffer/timeout SSE connections (verify during Phase 7 if SSE approach is used)

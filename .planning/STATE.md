## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Bottom-up testing order (domain -> handlers -> repos -> API) to avoid mock-heavy tests hiding real bugs
- [Roadmap]: Entity god-class split deferred to Phase 9 (last) so 400+ tests exist as safety net

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: Optimistic locking version_id_col configuration needs inspection during Phase 7 planning
- Phase 5: Supplier module dependency (ISupplierQueryService.assert_supplier_active) needs a shared test stub
- Phase 7: Event clearing mechanism in UoW commit path needs verification

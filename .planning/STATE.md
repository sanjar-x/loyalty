# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28)

**Core value:** The EAV Catalog module must be provably correct and thoroughly tested -- it is the foundation for cart, checkout, and order management.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — value-objects-entity-foundations

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (value-objects-entity-foundations) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-03-28

Progress: [..........] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Bottom-up testing order (domain -> handlers -> repos -> API) to avoid mock-heavy tests hiding real bugs
- [Roadmap]: Entity god-class split deferred to Phase 9 (last) so 400+ tests exist as safety net
- [Phase 01]: Used segment-based regex for slug generation to avoid hypothesis edge cases with hyphens
- [Phase 01]: Query counter accesses sync_connection (not async) per SQLAlchemy event API requirements
- [Phase 03]: Used parametrized tests for 13 invalid FSM transitions to auto-cover new transitions if FSM changes
- [Phase 03]: Created reusable _advance_to() FSM walker helper with pre-computed paths for DRY test setup
- [Phase 02]: Skipped code validation tests for Attribute/AttributeTemplate/AttributeGroup -- source does not validate code via _validate_slug, documented as deferred items

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: Optimistic locking version_id_col configuration needs inspection during Phase 7 planning
- Phase 5: Supplier module dependency (ISupplierQueryService.assert_supplier_active) needs a shared test stub
- Phase 7: Event clearing mechanism in UoW commit path needs verification
